Chicken – I have used whole bone-in chicken legs (thighs and legs) to make it. You can choose to use only legs (drumsticks) or even boneless breast cut in small cubes.

Whole chicken legs with thighs have more fat content making the tandoori chicken really juicy and moist. But if you want to go for a healthier version, use boneless chicken breast. Keep in mind that the breast will dry out fast post-cooking.

For the First Marination –

We will need salt, lime juice, ginger-garlic paste, and Kashmiri red chili powder. The first marination makes it tender and juicy when cooked.

For the Second Marination –

Thick yogurt – Thick yogurt binds all the spices and makes sure they cling well with the protein. You can use Greek yogurt if you have it or simply add the plain yogurt to a strainer and let it sit over a bowl for an hour. All the extra water will drip down and you will get thick yogurt.

Oil – To make authentic tandoori chicken, use mustard oil in the marination. It gives a very traditional taste to it. If mustard oil is not available, you can use any other oil.

You will also need ginger garlic paste, lime juice, and dry spices like Kashmiri red chili powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, turmeric powder, and coriander powder.

Adding freshly squeezed lime juice adds a nice tangy taste and also makes it juicy and tender.

Along with other spice powders, I have used Kashmiri red chili powder as it adds a nice red color without making it too spicy.

You can adjust the amount of spice powders as per your taste.

Kasuri Methi and Heavy Cream – Finally, adding some Kasuri methi and heavy cream gives it a restaurant-like taste.
